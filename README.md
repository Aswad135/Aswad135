### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Aswad's corner! He's a Software Engineering Grad who's been around the block, working as a Senior Software Engineer at some pretty cool places like [Telenor Microfinance Bank](https://www.telenor.com/about/our-companies/asia/telenor-financial-services/), [Photogauge](https://photogauge.com/), and [2iQ Research](https://www.2iqresearch.com/). Currently, he's diving deep into Full Stack Web Development, rocking Java SpringBoot, Angular, and NextJs like a pro! Oh, and don't forget his AWS chops â€“ he's got EC2, S3, Lambda, and more under his belt.

ðŸ”­ Right now, Aswad's cooking up some magic with Java Spring Boot, crafting super-efficient and robust Backend applications.

ðŸ”­ But wait, there's more! He's also got his hands full with Angular, whipping up Frontend applications that gobble up Restful APIs like nobody's business.

ðŸŒ± Oh, and did we mention he's on a DevOps learning spree? If you're a guru in the field, Aswad would love to pick your brain!

ðŸ“« Wanna chat? Drop him a line on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aswad135/). And hey, if you've got some wisdom to share, shoot him an email at [aswad.imvu@gmail.com](mailto:aswad.imvu@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20About%20Me). 

Let's connect and geek out together! ðŸš€
